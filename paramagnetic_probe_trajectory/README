This folder contains a 0.4 Î¼s molecular dynamics simulation of Gd-DTPA-BSA embedded in a 30% POPS / 70% POPC mixed lipid bilayer (gro:the first frame; xtc:0-400ns).
Due to GitHub's file size limit (<25 MB per file), a total of 154 trajectory frames (with water molecules removed) were uniformly extracted over the simulation time.
