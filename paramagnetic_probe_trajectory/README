This folder contains a 0.4 μs molecular dynamics simulation of Gd-DTPA-BSA embedded in a 30% POPS / 70% POPC mixed lipid bilayer (gro:the first frame; xtc:0-400ns).
Due to GitHub's file size limit (<25 MB per file), a total of 154 trajectory frames (with water molecules removed) were uniformly extracted over the simulation time.
The trajectory with finer sampling frequency， which was saved every 100 ps (also excluding water), is available on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/uploads/15311107).
